# UNEARTH
Final project for CS 2261 (Media Device Architecture) | April 2019 | Game Boy Advance emulator game

## Gameplay
"Mine bitcoins. Destroy goblins." In this single-player game, you are a dwarf looking for bitcoins. Move around and swing your axe on dirt patches, but beware of disturbing the goblins living underground. Mining a dirt patch could reveal a bitcoin or release a goblin. Released goblins will steal a bitcoin from your collection if they escape off-screen, but can be killed by swinging your axe. The Goblin Queen lives under one dirt patch that changes each time the game re-starts. There is a cheat that toggles the Goblin Queen, which can prevent her from being released. Releasing the Goblin Queen or losing all your bitcoins makes you lose the game.
